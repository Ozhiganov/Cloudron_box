Dear Admin,

User with name '<%= username %>' (<%= email %>) was added in the Cloudron at <%= fqdn %>.

You are receiving this email because you are an Admin of the Cloudron at <%= fqdn %>.

<% if (inviteLink) { %>
This user was not invited immediately, he has to get invited manually later, using the "send invite" button in the admin panel.
To perform any configuration on behalf of the user, please use this link
<%= inviteLink %>
It allows to setup a temporary password, which the user will be able to override, once he gets invited.
This link will become invalid as soon as the user was invited.
<% } %>

Thank you,
User Manager
