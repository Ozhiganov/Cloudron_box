# Introduction

The Cloudron is the best platform self-hosting web applications on your server. You
can easily install apps on it, add users, manage access restriction and keep your
server and apps updated with no effort.

You might wonder that there are so many 1-click app solutions out there and what is so special
about Cloudron? As the name implies, 1-click installers simply install code into a server
and leave it at that. There's so much more to do:

1. Configure a domain to point to your server
2. Setup SSL certificates and renew them periodically
3. Ensure apps are backed up correctly
4. Ensure apps are uptodate and secure
5. Have a mechanism to quickly restore apps from a backup
6. Manage users across all your apps
7. Get alerts and notifications about the status of apps

... and so on ...

We made the Cloudron to dramatically lower the bar for people to run apps on servers. Just provide
a domain name, install apps and add users. All the server management tasks listed above is
completely automated.

If you want to learn more about the secret sauce that makes the Cloudron, please read our
[architecture overview](/references/architecture.html).

# Use cases

Here are some of the apps you can run on a Cloudron:

* RSS Reader
* Chat, IRC, Jabber servers
* Public forum
* Blog
* File syncing and sharing
* Code hosting
* Email

Our list of apps is growing everyday, so be sure to [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/cloudron_io).

# Activation

When you first create the Cloudron, the setup wizard will ask you to setup an administrator
account. Don't worry, a Cloudron adminstrator doesn't need to know anything about maintaining
a server! It's the whole reason why we made the Cloudron. Being a Cloudron administrator is
more analagous to being the owner of a smartphone. You can always add more administrators to
the Cloudron from the `Users` menu item.

<img src="/docs/img/webadmin_domain.png" class="shadow">

The Cloudron administration page is located at the `my` subdomain. You might want to bookmark
this link!

# Apps

## Installation

You can install apps on the Cloudron by choosing the `App Store` menu item. Use the 'Search' bar
to search for apps.

Clicking on app gives you information about the app.

<img src="/docs/img/app_info.png" class="shadow">

Clicking the `Install` button will show an install dialog like below:

<img src="/docs/img/app_install.png" class="shadow">

The `Location` field is the subdomain in which your app will be installed. For example, if you use the
`mail` location for your web mail client, then it will be accessible at `mail.<domain>`.

Tip: You can access the apps directly on your browser using `mail.<domain>`. You don't have to
visit the Cloudron administration panel.

`Access control` specifies who can access this app.

* `Every Cloudron user` - Any user in your Cloudron can access the app. Initially, you are the only
   user in your Cloudron. Unless you explicitly invite others, nobody else can access these apps.
   Note that the term 'access' depends on the app. For a blog, this means that nobody can post new
   blog posts (but anybody can view them). For a chat server, this might mean that nobody can access
   your chat server.

* `Restrict to groups` - Only users in the groups can access the app.

## Updates

All your apps automatically update as and when the application author releases an update. The Cloudron
will attempt to update around midnight of your timezone.

Some app updates are not automatic. This can happen if a new version of the app has removed some features
that you were relying on. In such a case, the update has to be manually approved. This is simply a matter
of clicking the `Update` button (the green star) after you read about the changes.

<img src="/docs/img/app_update.png" class="shadow">

## Backups

<i>If you self-host, please refer to the [self-hosting documentation](/references/selfhosting.html#backups) for backups.</i>

All apps are automatically backed up every day. Backups are stored encrypted in Amazon S3. You don't have
to do anything about it. The [Cloudron CLI](https://git.cloudron.io/cloudron/cloudron-cli) tool can be used
to download application backups.

## Configuration

Apps can be reconfigured using the `Configure` button.

<img src="/docs/img/app_configure_button.png" class="shadow">

Click on the wrench button will bring up the configure dialog.

<img src="/docs/img/app_configure.png" class="shadow">

You can do the following:
* Change the location to move the app to another subdomain. Say, you want to move your blog from `blog` to `about`.
* Change who can access the app.

Changing an app's configuration has a small downtime (usually around a minute).

## Restore

Apps can be restored to a previous backup by clicking on the `Restore` button.

<img src="/docs/img/app_restore_button.png" class="shadow">

Note that restoring previous data might also restore the previous version of the software. For example, you might
be currently using Version 5 of the app. If you restore to a backup that was made with Version 3 of the app, then the restore
operation will install Version 3 of the app. This is because the latest version may not be able to handle old data.

## Uninstall

You can uninstall an app by clicking the `Uninstall` button.

<img src="/docs/img/app_uninstall_button.png" class="shadow">

Note that all data associated with the app will be immediately removed from the Cloudron. App data might still
persist in your old backups and the [CLI tool](https://git.cloudron.io/cloudron/cloudron-cli) provides a way to
restore from those old backups should it be required.

## Migration

Migrating apps from one Cloudron to another works by first creating a new backup of the app on the old Cloudron,
copying the backup tarball onto the new Cloudron's backup storage and then installing a new app, based on the backup on
the new Cloudron.

**Both Cloudrons have to use the same backup encryption key!**

The following step will migrate an app:
* Against the old Cloudron
```
cloudron backup create --app <subdomain/appid>
```
* Copy the new backup from the old Cloudron's backup storage to the new one. This can be done via the s3 webinterface
  or scp if the filesystem backend is used. The backup can be located by its backup ID, which can be seen with:
```
cloudron backup list --app <subdomain/appid>
```
* Make note of the app's appstore id and version from:
```
cloudron list
```
* Then login to the new Cloudron and install the new app based on the created backup:
```
cloudron login <new Cloudron domain>
cloudron install --appstore-id=<apps appstore id>@<specific version if required> --backup <backupId>
```
The backupId usually also includes a path prefix and looks like: `2017-07-17-121412-248/app_2d7f2a6a-4c17-43a6-80bc-0bd47a99727f_2017-07-17-121412-269_v4.1.1.tar.gz`

## Embedding Apps

It is possible to embed Cloudron apps into other websites. By default, this is disabled to prevent
[Clickjacking](https://cloudron.io/blog/2016-07-15-site-embedding.html).

You can set a website that is allowed to embed your Cloudron app using the app's [Configure dialog](#configuration).
Click on 'Show Advanced Settings...' and enter the embedder website name.

# Custom domain

When you create a Cloudron from cloudron.io, we provide a subdomain under `cloudron.me` like `girish.cloudron.me`.
Apps are available under that subdomain using a hyphenated name like `blog-girish.cloudron.me`.

Domain names are a thing of pride and the Cloudron makes it easy to make your apps accessible from memorable locations like `blog.girish.in`.

## Single app on a custom domain

This approach is applicable if you desire that only a single app be accessing from a custom
domain. For this, open the app's configure dialog and choose `External Domain` in the location dropdown.

<img src="/docs/img/app_external_domain.png" class="shadow">

This dialog will suggest you to add a `CNAME` record (for subdomains) or an `A` record (for naked domains).
Once you setup a record with your DNS provider, the app will be accessible from that external domain.

## Entire Cloudron on a custom domain

This approach is applicable if you want all your apps to be accessible from subdomains of your custom domain.
For example, `blog.girish.in`, `notes.girish.in`, `owncloud.girish.in`, `mail.girish.in` and so on. This
approach is also the only way that the Cloudron supports for sending and receiving emails from your domain.

For this, go to the 'Domains & Certs' menu item.

<img src="/docs/img/custom_domain_menu.png" class="shadow">

Change the domain name to your custom domain. Currently, we require that your domain be hosted on AWS Route53.

<img src="/docs/img/custom_domain_change.png" class="shadow">

Moving to a custom domain will retain all your apps and data and will take around 15 minutes. If you require assistance with another provider,
<a href="mailto:support@cloudron.io">just let us know</a>.

# User management

## Users

You can invite new users (friends, family, colleagues) with their email address from the `Users` menu. They will
receive an invite to sign up with your Cloudron. They can now access the apps that you have given them access
to.

<img src="/docs/img/users.png" class="shadow">

To remove a user, simply remove them from the list. Note that the removed user cannot access any app anymore.

## Administrators

A Cloudron administrator is a special right given to an existing Cloudron user allowing them to manage
apps and users. To make an existing user an administator, click the edit (pencil) button corresponding to
the user and check the `Allow this user to manage apps, groups and other users` checkbox.

<img src="/docs/img/administrator.png" class="shadow">

## Groups

Groups provide a convenient way to group users. It's purpose is two-fold:

* You can assign one or more groups to apps to restrict who can access for an app.
* Each group is a mailing list (forwarding address) constituting of it's members.

You can create a group by using the `Groups` menu item.

<img src="/docs/img/groups.png" class="shadow">

To set the access restriction use the app's configure dialog.

<img src="/docs/img/app_access_control.png" class="shadow">

You can now send mails to `groupname@<domain>` to address all the group members.

# Login

## Cloudron admin

The Cloudron admin page is always located at the `my` subdomain of your Cloudron domain. For custom domains,
this will be like `my.girish.in`. For domains from cloudron.io, this will be like `my-girish.cloudron.me`.

## Apps (single sign-on)

An important feature of the Cloudron is Single Sign-On. You use the same username & password for logging in
to all your apps. No more having to manage separate set of credentials for each service!

## Single user apps

Some apps only work with a single user. For example, a notes app might allow only a single user to login and add
notes. For such apps, you will be prompted during installation to select the single user who can access the app.

<img src="/docs/img/app_single_user.png" class="shadow">

If you want multiple users to use the app independently, simply install the app multiple times to different locations.

# Email

The Cloudron has a built-in email server. The primary email address is the same as the username. Emails can be sent
and received from `<username>@<domain>`. The Cloudron does not allow masquerading - one user cannot send email
pretending to be another user.

## Enabling Email

By default, Cloudron's email server only allows apps to send email. To enable users to send and receive email,
turn on the option under `Settings`. Turning on this option also allows apps to _receive_ email.

Once email is enabled, the Cloudron will keep the the `MX` DNS record updated.

<img src="/docs/img/enable_email.png" class="shadow">

## Receiving email using IMAP

Use the following settings to receive email.

  * Server Name - Use the `my` subdomain of your Cloudron
  * Port - 993
  * Connection Security - TLS
  * Username/password - Same as your Cloudron credentials

## Sending email using SMTP

Use the following settings to send email.

  * Server Name - Use the `my` subdomain of your Cloudron
  * Port - 587
  * Connection Security - STARTTLS
  * Username/password - Same as your Cloudron credentials

## Email filters using Sieve

Use the following settings to setup email filtering users via Manage Sieve.

  * Server Name - Use the `my` subdomain of your Cloudron
  * Port - 4190
  * Connection Security - TLS
  * Username/password - Same as your Cloudron credentials

The [Rainloop](https://cloudron.io/appstore.html?app=net.rainloop.cloudronapp) and [Roundcube](https://cloudron.io/appstore.html?app=net.roundcube.cloudronapp)
apps are already pre-configured to use the above settings.

## Aliases

You can configure one or more aliases alongside the primary email address of each user. You can set aliases by editing the
user's settings, available behind the edit button in the user listing. Note that aliases cannot conflict with existing user names.

<img src="/docs/img/email_alias.png" class="shadow">

Currently, it is not possible to login using the alias for SMTP/IMAP/Sieve services. Instead, add the alias as an identity in
your mail client but login using the Cloudron credentials.

## Subaddresses

Emails addressed to `<username>+tag@<domain>` will be delivered to the `username` mailbox. You can use this feature to give out emails of the form
`username+kayak@<domain>`, `username+aws@<domain>` and so on and have them all delivered to your mailbox.

## Catch All

A Catch-all mailbox is one that will "catch all" of the emails addressed to non-existent addresses. You can forward
such emails to one or more user mailboxes in the Email section. Note that if you do not select any mailbox (the default), Cloudron will send a bounce.

<img src="/docs/img/catch-all-mailbox.png" width="500" class="shadow">

## Forwarding addresses

Each group on the Cloudron is also a forwarding address. Mails can be addressed to `group@<domain>` and the mail will
be sent to each user who is part of the group.

## Marking Spam

The spam detection agent on the Cloudron requires training to identify spam. To do this, simply move your junk mails
to a pre-created folder named `Spam`. Most mail clients have a Junk or Spam button which does this automatically.

## Mail relay

By default, Cloudron's built-in email server sends out email directly to recipients. You can instead configure
the Cloudron to hand all outgoing emails to a 'mail relay' and have the relay deliver it to recipients. Such a
setup is useful when the Cloudron server does not have a good IP reputation for mail delivery or if server service provider does not allow sending email via port 25 (which is the case with Google Cloud and Amazon EC2).

Cloudron can be configured to send all outbound email via Amazon SES, Google, Mailgun, Postmark,
Sendgrid or any other external SMTP server. To setup a relay, enter the relay credentials in the Email section. Cloudron only supports relaying via the STARTTLS mechanism (usually port 587).

<img src="/docs/img/email-relay.png" width=500 class="shadow">

# Graphs

The Graphs view shows an overview of the disk and memory usage on your Cloudron.

<img src="/docs/img/graphs.png" class="shadow">

The `Disk Usage` graph shows you how much disk space you have left. Note that the Cloudron will
send the Cloudron admins an email notification when the disk is ~90% full.

The `Apps` Memory graph shows the memory consumed by each installed app. You can click on each segment
on the graph to see the memory consumption over time in the chart below it.

The `System` Memory graph shows the overall memory consumption on the entire Cloudron. If you see
the Free memory < 50MB frequently, you should consider upgrading to a Cloudron with more memory.

# Activity log

The `Activity` view shows the activity on your Cloudron. It includes information about who is using
the apps on your Cloudron and also tracks configuration changes.

<img src="/docs/img/activity.png" class="shadow">

# API Access

All the operations listed in this manual like installing app, configuring users and groups, are
completely programmable with a [REST API](/references/api.html).

# Domains and SSL Certificates

All apps on the Cloudron can only be reached by `https`. The Cloudron automatically installs and
renews certificates for your apps as needed. Should installation of certificate fail for reasons
beyond it's control, Cloudron admins will get a notification about it.

# OAuth Provider

Cloudron is an OAuth 2.0 provider. To integrate Cloudron login into an external application, create
an OAuth application under `API Access`.

You can use the following OAuth URLs to add Cloudron in the external app:
```
authorizationURL: https://my.<domain>/api/v1/oauth/dialog/authorize

tokenURL:         https://my.<domain>/api/v1/oauth/token
```

# Moving to a larger Cloudron

When using a Cloudron from cloudron.io, it is easy to migrate your apps and data to a bigger server.
In the `Settings` page, you can change the plan.

<insert picture>

# Command line tool

If you are a software developer or a sysadmin, the Cloudron comes with a CLI tool that can be
used to develop custom apps for the Cloudron. Read more about it [here](https://git.cloudron.io/cloudron/cloudron-cli).
