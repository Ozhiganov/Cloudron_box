Dear Cloudron Admin,

The application '<%= title %>' installed at <%= appFqdn %> is not responding.

This is most likely a problem in the application.

To resolve this, you can try the following:
* restart the app in the app configuration dialog
* restore the app to the latest backup
* contact us via support@cloudron.io or https://chat.cloudron.io
